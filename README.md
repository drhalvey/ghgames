# GH Games — George's Arcade

A free, static games site for George. Plain HTML and JavaScript, no build step, no server.
Hosted free on GitHub Pages at **ghgames.au**.

## What's in here

```
ghgames/
  index.html      the arcade homepage (game tiles)
  blackhole.html  drag-and-release: fling stars into a black hole
  sparrow.html    flappy-style sparrow, with score + best
  crazy-dads.html dads vs kids chase: soda knockouts, then the Monica & Didi boss (online via Supabase Realtime)
  CNAME           contains "ghgames.au" — tells GitHub Pages the domain
  README.md       this file
```

Open any `index.html` in a browser right now to play — nothing needs to be online to test.

## Putting it online (one-time setup — Ed does these)

These three steps need your card, your identity, and your logins, so they're yours, not George's.

**1. Register the domain.**
Go to [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au) (Australian registrar) and register **ghgames.au** in your name (~AUD 15/year). Note: `ghgames.com.au` is already taken by someone else, and `.au` direct doesn't need an ABN, so it's the easy one. Under-18s can't legally hold a domain, so it goes in your name.

**2. Create the GitHub repo.**
Make a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account, then a new **public** repository called `ghgames`. Upload the *contents* of this folder (so `index.html` sits at the top of the repo, not inside a `ghgames/` subfolder).

**3. Turn on Pages + point the domain.**
- In the repo: **Settings → Pages →** Source = "Deploy from a branch", Branch = `main`, folder = `/ (root)`. Save.
- The site goes live within a minute at `https://<your-username>.github.io/ghgames/`.
- In **VentraIP DNS settings**, add these records:

  | Type  | Host | Value           |
  |-------|------|-----------------|
  | A     | @    | 185.199.108.153 |
  | A     | @    | 185.199.109.153 |
  | A     | @    | 185.199.110.153 |
  | A     | @    | 185.199.111.153 |
  | CNAME | www  | `<your-username>.github.io` |

- Back in **Settings → Pages**, enter `ghgames.au` as the Custom domain and tick **Enforce HTTPS**.
- DNS can take a few hours. Once it loads cleanly, *then* tell George it's live.

## Adding a new game (the fun loop, forever after)

1. Build a self-contained `index.html` game (one file, plain HTML/JS), touch-friendly for iPad.
2. Save it as `<name>.html` in the same folder.
3. In the homepage `index.html`, turn the `class="card soon"` placeholder into a real tile:
   ```html
   <a class="card" href="<name>.html">
     <div class="emoji">🎮</div>
     <div class="name">Game Name</div>
     <div class="desc">One fun line about it.</div>
   </a>
   ```
4. Upload the changes to GitHub. Live in under a minute.

## House rules (keep it safe)

- Domain and accounts in **Ed's name only**.
- **No surname, school, suburb, or photos** anywhere on the site. First name and initials only.
